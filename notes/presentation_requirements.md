# Presentation Requirements

Final Presentations: 20-minutes max.

1. What was the motivation for your project (what problem did you solve?)
2. Demonstrate the application (if deployed to aws, demo it there)
   - New user registration
   - Log-in
   - Demo differences in functionality based on user type (logged in user versus guest. If you have different user roles, show the differences between them)
   - Demo functionality including full CRUD of data
   - Demo validation of data
   - Demo/explain your web service/api implementation
   - Demo/explain your error handling
   - Show log example - i.e., what/when are you logging and how does this add value? (this could be a screenshot)
   - Discuss your unit testing approach and show code coverage (this could be via a screenshot)
   - A video demonstration of the completed application published on GitHub is one of the deliverables. You could play the video to show some of the functionality described above, or you could do a live demo. Either way, at least show where your video demonstration is located during your presentation.
3. Demonstrate/explain any unique tech that researched and used
4. Highlight any unique parts or approaches in your application
5. If there are specific course competencies that you met with this project that you would like to emphasize, show off those aspects. This is your chance to shine!
6. Lessons learned/key takeaways
   - What would you repeat? What went well? What are you proud of?
   - What would you do differently?
7. If you were continuing with the project, what would you add/change in V2
